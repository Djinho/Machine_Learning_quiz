# Machine Learning Quiz Game

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I've created a simple, interactive quiz game focused on Machine Learning terminology. This Python script, `quiz_game.py`, is a fun way to test your knowledge on some of the fundamental acronyms in the field of Machine Learning. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn or an expert wanting to refresh your memory, this quiz offers a quick and engaging way to do so.

## Getting Started

To participate in the quiz, you'll need a basic setup that can run Python scripts. Here's how you can get started:

1. First, ensure you have Python installed on your computer. This game is compatible with Python 3.x versions.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the URL: `https://github.com/Djinho/Machine_Learning_quiz.git` or simply download the code.
3. Navigate to the directory where you've saved the script and run it using the command: `python quiz_game.py`
4. The game will prompt you to start. Respond with 'y' to begin the quiz.

## How to Play

The game consists of a series of questions related to acronyms commonly used in Machine Learning:

- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
- MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)

Your goal is to input the full form of these acronyms correctly. After you've responded to all questions, the game will tally your score and present it as both a count and a percentage of correct answers.
